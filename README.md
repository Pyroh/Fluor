# What is Fluor ?
**Fluor** is a tool that allows you to automatically change the behavior of the keyboard's fn keys depending on the active application. It's that simple.

# Instaling Fluor
There's two main ways to install **Fluor**:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/releases), open the DMG and drag the application to your `/Applications` folder.
2. Install via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io):  
`$ brew install fluor --cask`

You can also build it from source, but this is not recommended if your are only going to use **Fluor** in the regular way, and not hack it. 

# How does it work?

**Fluor** lies in your status bar and makes you see instantaneously which mode your keyboard is on:

- <img src="https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/blob/master/Fluor/Assets.xcassets/iconAppleModeTemplate.imageset/iconAppleModeTemplate@2x.png?raw=true" width=16pt> means that the keyboard's fn keys act like the default Apple function keys.
- <img src="https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/blob/master/Fluor/Assets.xcassets/iconOtherModeTemplate.imageset/iconOtherModeTemplate@2x.png?raw=true" width=16pt> means that the keyboard's fn keys act like these good old function keys (F1, F2, F3, you got it...).

## Fluor's menu
This is what you get when you click on **Fluor** in the status bar:

<img src="https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/blob/master/ressources/mainmenu.png?raw=true" width=279pt>

You can choose the default mode. Whenever **Fluor** runs it will activate the default mode for your keyboard's fn keys.

**Fluor** also displays the active application and its associated rule that you can change on the go.  
<img src="https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/blob/master/Fluor/Assets.xcassets/defaultModeTemplate.imageset/defaultModeTemplate@2x.png?raw=true" width=16pt> is the default rule and means that the application will adopt default Fluor's keyboard behaviour.

You can also disable **Fluor** if you need to. It will set the keyboard's behaviour as it was prior to the application's launch. 

## Rules Editor
<img src="https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/blob/master/ressources/ruleseditor.png?raw=true" width=412pt>

This panel allows you to see all the rules you set at once. You can modify or delete any rule. Adding a rule will prompt a file selector in which you'll be able to select the application you want to set a rule for.

## Running Applications
<img src="https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/blob/master/ressources/runningapps.png?raw=true" width=412pt>

Sometimes it is not possible to select an application in the *Rules Editor*, especially for Steam games. This panel lets you set a rule for any running application. Of course the rules you set in this panel will be available directly in the *Rules Editor*. You can also remove a rule by setting the application behaviour to <img src="https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor/blob/master/Fluor/Assets.xcassets/defaultModeTemplate.imageset/defaultModeTemplate@2x.png?raw=true" width=16pt>, it will also disappear from the *Rules Editor* panel.

# Why is it open source ?
I made **Fluor** because I needed such an application. I wanted it simple, nicely designed and free and I didn't find such a thing on the internet. Once it was done I used it for a little while, cleaned up the code and decided to give it to others for free. What was a requirement for me can well be a requirement for others too.  
You'd argue that such a non-sandboxed app had no chance to hit the AppStore and you'd be right. But if I had the chance it would have remained free and open-source. I don't think there's many people needing such an app and I prefer seeing it used by a wider range of people.  

This app is also built using open-source code, that's why I think it belongs to this world. And if someone learns something looking at the code I'll be happy ðŸ˜ƒ.
